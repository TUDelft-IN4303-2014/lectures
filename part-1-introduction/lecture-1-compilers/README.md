We start this lecture with some general comments on the properties of language. We then discuss artificial languages employed in software engineering, so called software languages. Next, we introduce compilers which translate such high-level software languages to low-level machine code which is then executed either on a real or virtual machine. You will learn about traditional compilers as well as about modern compilers which integrate into Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Eclipse. We present the features and the architecture of both kinds of compilers. In a next step, we address compiler construction. We present different strategies to build a compiler. You will learn about helpful tools in this process, their features, and their architecture. We conclude the lecture with information about the organisation of the course.
