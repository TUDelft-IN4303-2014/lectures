We lay the foundations of this course in two lectures. 
The first lecture sets the scene for the course. We give an overview about 
language in general, 
software languages in particular, 
the need for compilers, 
and how they can be constructed. 
The second lecture introduces the core concepts of imperative and object-oriented programming languages.
